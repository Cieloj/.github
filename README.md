Ĉieloj is a new open source project with the aim of building a modern control panel for webhosts of all sizes.

It will be designed and put together using open source tools and with a focus on data privacy, ethics, and sustainability.

At the centre of it all is a desire to make a piece of software with a clear direction, that knows what it wants to be. What we don’t want to create is a bloated behemoth of a piece of software, but rather something light and agile, that is adaptable and extensible.

Right now, we are right at the start of a project in flux that currently exists purely as a series of discussions and thought processes.

## Governance

A lot of open source projects ultimately fail at some point because of a lack of governance, they rely entirely on one or two maintainers and developers, and when those people either no longer have time to commit to the project, or lose interest, it flounders.

We want to build clear governance and multiple maintainers from the start. The project team, maintainers, sponsors, etc. should be publicly visible.

Ultimately, we aim to create a non-profit software foundation or cooperative, which will have safeguards put in place to ensure that the project software will always stay free and open source, and that it can not die if any one participant leaves the project.

Until we reach that point we aim at the very least to be transparent and clear in governance and decision making.

We will also aim to clearly outline the future direction and roadmap and plan for commits to adhere to it, together with an explanation of the process behind major project decisions.

## Community

No open source project can survive without an active community.

We all have different skills and we would like to coordinate and leverage those to create something amazing.

To do that we need to have clear channels of communication. We need to decide on and set up community communication channels.

This might be through Slack, Discord, Gitter, or something else that is yet to be decided, there may also be a community forum if that would be useful. Perhaps we can explore an open source alternative to Slack.

## What’s in a name?

Ĉieloj – meaning skies in Esperanto. This is something that can be contributed to and used by anyone around the world, so we picked a name in the most international language we could find, and the skies are where clouds live.

## Overall aim & architecture

Ĉieloj aims to be a framework for hosting providers or system admins to be able to control their servers easily and efficiently. 

The original idea for the project was to create two separate applications that would be designed to work perfectly together but also be usable individually, or able to integrate with other existing solutions.

One of them would be a very simple billing and client management app designed for web hosting, including invoicing and a customer support system. This idea has currently been shelved for the near term future and instead we will be working on making the server/hosting control panel integrate with the open source billing software project FOSSBilling

The second and main part of the Ĉieloj project is a server/hosting control panel, consisting of a simple modern framework for multi-server control, with additional functions and features added by extension modules.  

What really sets Ĉieloj apart from all of the other open source control panels out there is that we are starting with a clean slate with nothing set in stone from the outset, everything is up for question and debate with decisions ultimately taken because they will work well for the project and not because they are the 'norm' or the 'standard'. 


Ubuntu? Maybe, but maybe FreeBSD is actually a better OS to build from. 

nginx? Maybe, but maybe Lightppd actually does what we want better.

PowerDNS or Bind? Again maybe, but maybe there is a better option.

Phase one will be the control panel, with the billing and client management solution possibly following at a later date as phase two.

The logic here is simple the server control panel is the core and most important part of the project, and while there are a lot of pretty decent solutions out there none of them actually fits in with our aims entirely.

Although there are very few open source options for billing and client management out there and those that do exist have serious issues, this is really a secondary aim for Ĉieloj, and FOSSBilling looks like developing into a good solution in the near future. 

## Roadmap

It’s a bit early for a clear roadmap, but we do want to get things moving. Right now, let’s just say:

* Outline of project direction – June 2022
* Setup of discussion forum and comms channels – June 2022
* Broad decisions about project structure - August 2022
* First code commits – August 2022

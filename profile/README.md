Ĉieloj is an open source project building a modern control panel for webhosts of all sizes.

It will be designed and put together using open source tools and with a focus on data privacy, ethics, and sustainability.

At the centre of it all is a desire to make a piece of software with a clear direction, that knows what it wants to be. What we don’t want to create is a bloated behemoth of a piece of software, but rather something light and agile, that is adaptable and extensible.

## Ĉei-what?

Ĉieloj – meaning skies in Esperanto. This is something that can be contributed to and used by anyone around the world, so we picked a name in the most international language we could find, and the skies are where clouds live.
